## Coding Challenge

### Summary:

Use Ruby on Rails to create a simple web application that turns off the lights at a home when no one is there.

### Application Requirements:
* The source code should be in a public git repository on github or bitbucket
* The repo should have multiple branches and multiple commits
* The web app should be deployed on heroku so that it's publicly accessible online
* The web app should connect with a Samsung Smartthings app to communicate with the light switch (hint: use the smartthings classic documentation tutorial code)

### Feature Requirements:
* A user can create and delete a listing.
* A user can add or remove devices to a listing. A device can be a light switch, a lock, or a thermostat. Multiple devices of the same type can be added to a listing.
* A user can turn on and turn off Automation Service for a listing.
* A user can create and delete a reservation for a listing.
* A listing with Automation Service turned on will turn off any light switches when a reservation ends at the listing.
* A user should be able to see the current status of a light switch (as it is in the Smartthings App).

### Bonus (Optional):
* Make it look nice
